## Troubleshooting

```
Downloads all products as Excel

```
POST /api/admin/products/bulk-import
```

---

## Technical Details

### Update Detection Logic:
1. File uploaded
2. Check each row for "Product ID" column
3. If Product ID exists ‚Üí `UPDATE` query
4. If Product ID missing ‚Üí `CREATE` query
5. Return summary: created vs updated

### Database Query:
```javascript
if (productId) {
  await productsAPI.update(productId, data);  // UPDATE
} else {
  await productsAPI.create(data);              // CREATE
}
```
