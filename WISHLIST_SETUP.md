# Wishlist Feature Setup Guide

## Overview
The wishlist feature has been implemented with the following capabilities:
- âœ… Store wishlist data in Supabase database (for logged-in users)
- âœ… Store wishlist in localStorage (for non-logged-in users)
- âœ… Sync localStorage wishlist to database when user logs in
- âœ… Remove items from wishlist (syncs with database)
- âœ… Display full product details in user account page

## Database Setup

### Step 1: Run the SQL Schema
You need to create the wishlist table in your Supabase database:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor** from the left sidebar
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy and paste the contents of `wishlist-schema.sql` file
6. Click **Run** or press `Ctrl+Enter`

The SQL file creates:
- A `wishlist` table to store user wishlist items
- Indexes for faster lookups
- Foreign key relationship with the `users` table

### Alternative: Use existing users.wishlist column
If you prefer to keep using the existing `wishlist` column in the `users` table (which is already set up), you don't need to run the SQL file. The current implementation already uses this approach.

## How It Works

### For Non-Logged-In Users:
1. When a user adds products to wishlist, they are stored in **localStorage**
2. Data persists across browser sessions
3. When user logs in, localStorage wishlist is automatically synced to database

### For Logged-In Users:
1. Wishlist items are stored in the database under `users.wishlist` column
2. Only **product IDs** are stored in database (not full product data)
3. When displaying wishlist, full product details are fetched from the products table
4. Changes are synced in real-time to the database

### Key Features:
- âœ… **Add to Wishlist**: Click heart icon on product cards
- âœ… **Remove from Wishlist**: Click heart icon again or use remove button in account page
- âœ… **View Wishlist**: Go to `/wishlist` or account page â†’ Wishlist tab
- âœ… **Auto-sync**: localStorage wishlist syncs to database on login
- âœ… **Full Product Display**: Shows complete product info with images, prices, stock status

## File Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema
- **File**: `wishlist-schema.sql` (optional - for separate wishlist table)
- Current implementation uses existing `users.wishlist` column

### 2. API Routes
- **File**: `src/app/api/user/wishlist/route.js` (already existed)
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /api/user/wishlist` - Fetch user's wishlist
  - `POST /api/user/wishlist` - Add product to wishlist
  - `DELETE /api/user/wishlist` - Remove product from wishlist

### 3. Wishlist Context
- **File**: `src/context/WishlistContext.js`
- Added database sync functionality
- Added localStorage support for non-logged-in users
- Auto-sync on login

### 4. Account Page
- **File**: `src/app/account/page.js`
- Updated to display full product details instead of just IDs
- Added product images, prices, and stock status
- Added remove button for each wishlist item

### 5. Product Card
- **File**: `src/components/ProductCard.js` (no changes needed)
- Already has wishlist functionality

## Testing

### Test for Non-Logged-In Users:
1. Visit the products page without logging in
2. Click heart icon on any product
3. Go to `/wishlist` - you should see the product
4. Refresh the page - wishlist should persist (localStorage)
5. Log in - wishlist should sync to database automatically

### Test for Logged-In Users:
1. Log in to your account
2. Go to products page and add items to wishlist
3. Check your account page â†’ Wishlist tab
4. You should see full product cards with images and details
5. Try removing items - they should be removed from database
6. Log out and log back in - wishlist should persist

## API Testing

You can test the API endpoints using the following:

```bash
# Get wishlist (requires auth token)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/user/wishlist \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Add to wishlist
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/user/wishlist \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"productId": "PRODUCT_ID"}'

# Remove from wishlist
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/user/wishlist \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"productId": "PRODUCT_ID"}'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Wishlist not syncing?
- Check if JWT token is valid in localStorage
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase connection in `.env` file

### Products not showing in account page?
- Make sure products exist in the database
- Check if product IDs in wishlist match actual product IDs
- Verify `/api/products` endpoint is working

### localStorage not persisting?
- Check if browser allows localStorage
- Try clearing cache and cookies
- Check browser console for localStorage errors

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Run the SQL file (optional) or keep using existing setup
2. âœ… Test the wishlist functionality
3. âœ… Verify database sync is working
4. âœ… Check both logged-in and non-logged-in flows

All set! Your wishlist feature is ready to use. ðŸŽ‰
