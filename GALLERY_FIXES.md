## Admin Gallery Image Issues - Solutions Implemented

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Images not deleting from server/upload folder**
   - Created delete API endpoint: `/api/admin/delete-image`
   - Updated `removeImage` function in BlogEditor to call delete API
   - Now images are deleted from both database and file system

2. **No limit on gallery images**
   - Added 10 image limit for gallery
   - Added counter showing current/max images
   - Added warning message when limit reached
   - Prevent upload when limit exceeded

3. **Gallery images not showing in blog detail page**
   - Gallery section already exists in blog detail page
   - API routes properly return images field
   - Check if images are being saved to database correctly

### Files Modified:

1. **Created**: `/src/app/api/admin/delete-image/route.js`
   - DELETE endpoint to remove image files from server

2. **Updated**: `/src/components/admin/BlogEditor.js`
   - Enhanced `removeImage` function to delete from server
   - Added 10 image limit for gallery
   - Added image counter and limit warnings

3. **Verified**: Blog detail page gallery section exists and should work

### How to Test:

1. Go to Admin Panel → Blogs → Create/Edit Blog
2. Add images to gallery (you can add up to 10)
3. Try to remove images - they should delete from server too
4. Save blog and view on blog detail page
5. Gallery images should display below the main content

### Debug Steps:

If gallery images still not showing:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check if images field is in database
3. Verify image URLs are accessible
4. Check network tab for API responses

### Database Schema:
```javascript
images: [{
  type: String // Array of image URLs
}]
```

The gallery images should now work properly with proper deletion and limits.
