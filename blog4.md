Blog 4: Windows 10 vs Windows 11 Laptops in Pakistan Expert Tips by Mohit Computers
When it comes to buying a laptop in Pakistan, one of the first questions people ask nowadays is, “Windows 10 loon ya Windows 11 better hai?”
And honestly, the confusion makes sense. Some users don’t want to upgrade because they feel Windows 10 is stable. Others want Windows 11 because it looks fresh and modern. Add in Pakistan’s huge variety of laptops Dell Latitude, HP business laptops, Lenovo Yoga models and the decision becomes even trickier.
To make things simple, here’s a practical breakdown of Windows 10 vs Windows 11 laptops in Pakistan, based on what buyers actually experience, not what Microsoft markets. These insights come from daily customer queries handled at Mohit Computers, one of the trusted laptop dealers and importers in Sindh.

Windows 10 – Still Loved for Its Stability
Even in 2025, a lot of people in Pakistan prefer Windows 10. And their reasons aren’t wrong.
Windows 10 is known for being:
•	familiar
•	stable
•	easy on older hardware
•	less buggy on mid-range laptops
Most Dell Latitude business laptops in Karachi, especially the older models like Latitude 5480, 5490, 5495, or even HP EliteBook G5/G6 units, run extremely well on Windows 10. These laptops are built for business performance rather than flashy design, so Windows 10 feels naturally “made” for them.
Why Windows 10 Is Still a Safe Choice
•	It uses fewer resources, especially RAM and GPU.
•	Older apps, software, and corporate tools still support it fully.
•	Drivers for older models are available everywhere.
•	Fewer compatibility issues for people shifting from old systems.
In Pakistan’s market, many freelancers, students, and office users prefer Windows 10 because it feels smooth even on mid-range processors.
Where Windows 10 Falls Behind
•	No longer gets major feature updates.
•	UI feels a bit dated for users who prefer modern interfaces.
•	Future support will reduce slowly over the next few years.
So while Windows 10 is still reliable, it’s not the system for people who want the newest features or plan to keep their laptop for many years.

Windows 11 – Modern, Fast, and Designed for Newer Laptops
Windows 11 shows its real potential when installed on a newer device — especially models like HP EliteBook G7/G8, Dell Latitude 7420/7430, and Lenovo Yoga laptops in Pakistan. With these newer processors, you notice the difference immediately.
Windows 11 feels cleaner, more responsive, and more visually appealing. It’s also built with modern hardware in mind — things like AI tools, better touchscreens, and faster SSDs.
Why People Prefer Windows 11 Now
•	Slick design and clean interface
•	Faster boot times and app switching
•	Better support for hybrid work (teams, zoom, multitasking)
•	Improved security
•	Perfect for touchscreens and 2-in-1 laptops
If you’re buying a new laptop or a slightly recent model (10th gen and above), Windows 11 usually feels smoother than Windows 10.
Where Windows 11 Can Be Annoying
•	Not ideal for older laptops with older processors
•	Some older applications struggle
•	Slightly heavier on RAM
•	Takes some time to adjust if you’re used to Windows 10
It’s a modern OS, but it expects modern hardware.

Performance Comparison: Which One Runs Better in Pakistan?
Pakistan’s laptop market is full of imported used units, and that affects which Windows version performs best.
For Business Laptops (Dell Latitude, HP EliteBook, ThinkPad):
•	7th–8th gen laptops: Windows 10 runs better
•	10th gen and above: Windows 11 performs beautifully
That’s why most Dell Latitude laptops in Karachi from older generations come preloaded with Windows 10 — it simply performs better on business-grade hardware that wasn’t designed with Windows 11 in mind.
For Touchscreen & 2-in-1 Laptops (Lenovo Yoga, HP x360):
Windows 11 wins by a mile.
Touch gestures, animations, and tablet mode work perfectly on Windows 11 compared to Windows 10.
For Students and Freelancers:
Windows 10 is more stable for:
•	office work
•	zoom classes
•	daily assignments
•	basic graphic designing
Windows 11 is better for:
•	creative tools
•	modern UI needs
•	multitasking-heavy users

App Support & Compatibility in Pakistan
Here’s how both versions perform with common usage:
Windows 10 works better with older software like:
•	AutoCAD 2016–2020
•	Older ERP tools
•	Traditional office setups
Windows 11 handles modern apps better:
•	Figma
•	Canva
•	Adobe 2023+
•	AI-based tools
•	Any app requiring newer hardware acceleration
So your usage type matters a lot.

Gaming and GPU Performance
If you’re using a laptop with an NVIDIA GTX or RTX GPU, both Windows versions perform almost equally well.
The difference is more noticeable on integrated graphics.
•	Intel 7th–8th gen integrated graphics → Windows 10 smoother
•	Intel 12th–13th gen integrated graphics → Windows 11 smoother
Gamers with older gaming laptops often stick to Windows 10 for fewer hiccups.

Which One Should You Buy in 2025?
 Choose Windows 10 if:
•	You’re buying a used laptop (older than 10th gen)
•	You want stability over new features
•	You depend on old software
•	You want the least number of compatibility issues
•	You’re on a tighter budget
 Choose Windows 11 if:
•	You’re buying a newer laptop
