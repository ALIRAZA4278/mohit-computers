Blog 6: Best Laptops for Graphic Designing & Gaming in Pakistan – Mohit Computers Picks
If you do graphic designing or gaming in Pakistan, you’ve probably already noticed how quickly a normal laptop starts struggling. A few Photoshop layers, a heavy Illustrator file, or a mid-range game — and suddenly, your system slows down, fans ramp up, and the whole workflow becomes a headache.
That’s why picking the right machine matters. Graphic designers need color accuracy and smooth performance, while gamers want strong FPS and stable thermals. The interesting part? Many laptops today are powerful enough to handle both — if you choose the right one.
Based on everyday customer queries, software requirements, and real testing at Mohit Computers, here’s a practical, no-fluff guide to the best laptops for graphic designing & gaming in Pakistan.

What Graphic Designers Actually Need in a Laptop
People assume that a “good design laptop” just means high RAM and an SSD — but that’s only half the story. Real design work demands:
•	A color-accurate display
•	Smooth performance in Adobe apps
•	Strong GPU acceleration
•	Fast rendering for large projects
Software like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and After Effects depend heavily on the GPU. When your laptop doesn’t have enough graphics power, you’ll experience lag, slow exports, or crashing.
Why Designers Prefer Workstation or Gaming GPUs
NVIDIA GTX/RTX and AMD Radeon RX GPUs perform extremely well in:
•	Adobe Creative Cloud
•	DaVinci Resolve
•	Figma
•	Blender
•	3D editing tools
•	Motion graphics
Even a mid-range GTX 1650 often outperforms many “office laptops” that cost more. That’s why creative professionals usually lean toward gaming laptops or business workstations — they simply offer more value per rupee.

What Gamers Need – FPS, Thermals & GPU Strength
Gamers in Pakistan look at things slightly differently. While designers focus on accuracy, gamers need:
•	A powerful GPU (GTX/RTX or Radeon RX series)
•	Good cooling to avoid frame drops
•	High refresh rate display (120Hz/144Hz+)
•	Stable performance without overheating
Games like GTA V, Valorant, Cyberpunk 2077, FC24, and Red Dead Redemption 2 rely heavily on a good GPU and proper heat management.
The moment a laptop starts heating up, FPS drops — which ruins the experience.
So when a laptop handles gaming well, it naturally handles designing well too.
